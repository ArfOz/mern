//Questions 2/a
const num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
console.log("questions", num)

//Questions 2/b I will write explicitly. At first I start function. So I expect that result have to be between 0-6. I can write this mocha.js

//Questions3 I didnt know the difference. but I searched text files are human readeble. But binary is not. 

//Bonus question I think trains go to the west side are 4 times more to the trains go to the east side.
